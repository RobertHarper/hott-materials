      <h2>Synopsis</h2>

      <p> This is a graduate research seminar on Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), a
      recent enrichment of Intuitionistic Type Theory (ITT) to include
      "higher-dimensional" types.  The dimensionality of a type refers
      to the structure of its <em>paths</em>, the constructive witnesses to the
      equality of pairs of elements of a type, which themselves form a type, the
      <em>identity type</em>.  In general a type is <em>infinite
      dimensional</em> in the sense that it exhibits non-trivial structure at
      all dimensions: it has elements, paths between elements, paths between
      paths, and so on to all finite levels.  Moreover, the paths at each level
      exhibit the algebraic structure of a <em>(higher) groupoid</em>, meaning
      that there is always the "null path" witnessing reflexivity, the
      "inverse" path witnessing symmetry, and the
      "concatenation" of paths witnessing transitivity such that
      group-like laws hold "up to higher homotopy".  Specifically,
      there are higher-dimensional paths witnessing the associative, unital, and
      inverse laws for these operations.  Altogether this means that a type is a
      <em>weak ∞-groupoid</em>.  </p>

      <p> The significance of the higher-dimensional structure of types lies in
      the concept of a <em>type-indexed family of types</em>.  Such families
      exhibit the structure of a <em>fibration</em>, which means that a path
      between two indices "lifts" to a <em>transport</em> mapping
      between the corresponding instances of the family that is, in fact, an
      equivalence.  Thinking of paths as constructive witnesses for equality,
      this amounts to saying that equal indices give rise to equivalent types,
      and hence, by univalence, equal elements of the universe in which the
      family is valued.  Thus, for example, if we think of the interval I as a
      type with two endpoints connected by a path, then an I-indexed family of
      types must assign equivalent types to the endpoints.  In contrast the type
      B of booleans consists of two disconnected points, so that a B-indexed
      family of types may assign unrelated types to the two points of B.
      Similarly, mappings from I into another type A must assign connected
      points in A to the endpoints of the interval, whereas mappings from B into
      A are free to assign arbitrary points of A to the two booleans.  These
      preservation principles are central to the structure of HoTT.
      </p>

      <p> In many cases the path structure of a type becomes trivial beyond a
      certain dimension, called the <em>level</em> of the type.  By convention
      the levels start at -2 and continue through -1, 0, 1, 2, and so on
      indefinitely.  At the lowest, -2, level, the path structure of a type is
      degenerate in that there is an element to which all other elements are
      equal; such a type is said to be <em>contractible</em>, and is essentially
      a singleton.  At the next higher level, -1, the type of paths between any
      two elements is contractible (level -2), which means that any two elements
      are equal, if there are any elements at all; such as type is a
      <em>sub-singleton</em> or <em>h-proposition</em>.  At the next level, 0,
      the type of paths between paths between elements is contractible, so that
      any two elements are equal "in at most one way"; such a type is
      a <em>set</em> whose types of paths (equality relations) are all h-prop's.
      Continuing in this way, types of level 1 are <em>groupoids</em>, those of
      level 2 are <em>2-groupoids</em>, and so on for all finite levels.  </p>

      <p> ITT is capable of expressing only sets, which are types of level 0.
      Such types may have elements, and two elements may be considered equal in
      at most one way.  A large swath of (constructive) mathematics may be
      formulated using only sets, and hence is amenable to representation in
      ITT.  Computing applications, among others, require more than just sets.
      For example, it is often necessary to suppress distinctions among elements
      of a type so as to avoid over-specification; this is called <em>proof
      irrelevance</em>.  Traditionally ITT has been enriched with an <em>ad
      hoc</em> treatment of proof irrelevance by introducing a universe of
      "propositions" with no computational content.  In HoTT such
      propositions are types of level -1, requiring no special treatment or
      distinction.  Such types arise by <em>propositional truncation</em> of a
      type to render degenerate the path structure of a type above level -1,
      ensuring that any two elements are equal in the sense of having a path
      between them.  </p>

      <p> Propositional truncation is just one example of a <em>higher inductive
      type</em>, one that is defined by specifying generators not only for its
      elements, but also for its higher-dimensional paths.  The propositional
      truncation of a type is one that includes all of the elements of the type,
      and, in addition, a path between any two elements, rendering them equal.
      It is a limiting case of a <em>quotient type</em> in which only certain
      paths between elements are introduced, according to whether they are
      deemed to be related.  Higher inductive types also permit the
      representation of higher-dimensional objects, such as the spheres of
      arbitrary dimension, as types, simply by specifying their
      "connectivity" properties.  For example, the topological circle
      consists of a base point and a path starting and ending at that point, and
      the topological disk may be thought of as two half circles that are
      connected by a higher path that "fills in" the interior of the
      circle. Because of their higher path structure, such types are not sets,
      and neither are constructions such as the product of two circles.
      </p>

      <p>The <em>univalence axiom</em> implies that an equivalence between types
      (an "isomorphism up to isomorphism") determines a path in a
      universe containing such types.  Since two types can be equivalent in many
      ways (for example, there can be distinct bijections between two sets),
      univalence gives rise to types that are not sets, but rather are of a
      higher level, or dimension.  The univalence axiom is mathematically
      efficient because it allows us to treat equivalent types as equal, and
      hence interchangeable in all contexts.  In informal settings such
      identifications are often made by convention; in formal homotopy type
      theory such identifications are true equations.
